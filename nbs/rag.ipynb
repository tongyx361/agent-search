We need to further simplify the equation.\\n\\nWe know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $x_2-x_1=6$, and the Vieta\\'s formulas give us that the sum of the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ is $x_1 +x_2 =-\\\\frac{b}{a} = -\\\\frac{-2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $x_1x_2 = \\\\frac{c}{a} = \\\\frac{l - 4}{k}$. So we can use the identity $\\\\left(x_1 - x_2\\\\right)^2 = \\\\left(x_1 + x_2\\\\right)^2 - 4x_1x_2$ to find a relationship between $k$ and $l$.\\n\\nBy substitution, we have $\\\\left(x_1 - x_2\\\\right)^{2} = - 4\\\\cdot\\\\frac{l - 4}{k} = 6^2$, which simplifies to $4 - \\\\frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$, or $\\\\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -32$. Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives $4l - 16 = -32k$, or $4l = 16 - 32k$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $l = 4 - 8k$.\\n\\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $l$ into the sum of squares of distances to get the final result.\\n\\n```python\\ndef sum_of_squares_of_distances_final():\\n    \"\"\"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters.
