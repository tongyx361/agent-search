However, the minimum value of a real-valued function should be a non-negative real number. It seems that there's a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-examine the problem.\\n\\nThe function we are trying to minimize is $\\\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$, and we know that $ab = 8$. So we can substitute $b = \\\\frac{8}{a}$ into the function:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{a^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{8}{a}\\\\right)^2}{a - \\\\frac{8}{a}} = \\\\frac{a^2 + \\\\frac{64}{a^2}}{a - \\\\frac{8}{a}} = \\\\frac{a^4 + 64}{a^2 - 8}.$$\\n\\nNow let's find the derivative of this function with respect to $a$:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{d}{da} \\\\left(\\\\frac{a^4 + 64}{a^2 - 8}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{(4a^3)(a^2 - 8) - (2a)(a^4 + 64)}{(a^2 - 8)^2} = \\\\frac{4a^5 - 32a^3 - 2a^5 - 128a}{(a^2 - 8)^2} = \\\\frac{2a^5 - 32a^3 - 128a}{(a^2 - 8)^2}.$$\\n\\nSetting this equal to zero to find the critical points:\\n\\n$$2a^5 - 32a^3 - 128a = 0 \\\\implies a^5 - 16a^3 - 64a = 0 \\\\implies a(a^4 - 16a^2 - 64) = 0.$$\\n\\nThis gives us $a = 0$ or $a^4 - 16a^2 - 64 = 0$. The first root $a = 0$ doesn't make sense in the context of the problem (we need $a > 0$), so we need to solve the second equation:\\n\\n$$a^4 - 16a^2 - 64 = 0.$$\\n\\nThis is a quadratic equation in $a^2$. Let $x = a^2$, then the equation becomes:\\n\\n$$x^2 - 16x - 64 = 0.$$\\n\\nWe can solve this using the quadratic formula:\\n\\n$$x = \\\\frac{-(-16) \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{(-16)^2 - 4*1*(-64)}}{2*1} = \\\\frac{16 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{256 + 256}}{2} = \\\\frac{16 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{512}}{2} = \\\\frac{16 \\\\pm 16\\\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 8 \\\\pm 8\\\\sqrt{2}.$$\\n\\nSince $a^2 = x > 0$, we only consider the positive root:\\n\\n$$a^2 = 8 + 8\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\implies a = \\\\sqrt{8 + 8\\\\sqrt{2}}.$$\\n\\nNow we can find the corresponding value of $b$:\\n\\n$$b = \\\\frac{8}{a} = \\\\frac{8}{\\\\sqrt{8 + 8\\\\sqrt{2}}} = \\\\frac{8\\\\sqrt{8 - 8\\\\sqrt{2}}}{(8 + 8\\\\sqrt{2}) - 64} = \\\\frac{8\\\\sqrt{8 - 8\\\\sqrt{2}}}{8\\\\sqrt{2}} = \\\\sqrt{4 - 4\\\\sqrt{2}}.$$\\n\\nNow we can find the minimum value of the function:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b} = \\\\frac{(\\\\sqrt{8 + 8\\\\sqrt{2}})^2 + (\\\\sqrt{4 - 4\\\\sqrt{2}})^2}{\\\\sqrt{8 + 8\\\\sqrt{2}} - \\\\sqrt{4 - 4\\\\sqrt{2}}} = \\\\frac{8 + 8\\\\sqrt{2} + 4 - 4\\\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6.$$\\n\\nSo the minimum value of $\\\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$ is $6$. Therefore, the minimum value of $\\\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$ is $6$.

However, the problem statement specifies that the minimum value must be a non-negative integer. It seems that there was an error in the solution. Let's re-examine the problem and the solution.\\n\\nThe problem asks for the minimum value of the expression $\\\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$ under the constraints that $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers with $a > b$ and $ab = 8$. The expression $\\\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$ is not a simple function to minimize directly. However, we can use the constraint $ab = 8$ to express $b$ in terms of $a$, and then substitute this into the expression to get a function of $a$ only. This gives us $f(a) = \\\\frac{a^2 + \\\\frac{64}{a^2}}{a - \\\\frac{8}{a}}$.\\n\\nNow, let's take the derivative of $f(a)$ with respect to $a$ and set it equal to zero to find the critical points. This gives us $f'(a) = 0$. Solving this equation is not straightforward, and it turns out that this function does not have a simple algebraic minimum.\\n\\nHowever, we can use the AM-GM inequality to find a lower bound for the function. The AM-GM inequality states that for any positive real numbers $x$ and $y$, we have $\\\\frac{x+y}{2} \\\\geq \\\\sqrt{xy}$. Applying this to $x = a^2$ and $y = \\\\frac{64}{a^2}$, we get $\\\\frac{a^2 + \\\\frac{64}{a^2}}{2} \\\\geq \\\\sqrt{a^2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{64}{a^2}} = 8$. Therefore, $\\\\frac{a^2 + \\\\frac{64}{a^2}}{a - \\\\frac{8}{a}} \\\\geq \\\\frac{16}{a - \\\\frac{8}{a}}$.\\n\\nNow, we want to minimize $\\\\frac{16}{a - \\\\frac{8}{a}}$. Taking the derivative of this function with respect to $a$ and setting it equal to zero gives us $a = 4$. Substituting $a = 4$ into the expression gives us $\\\\frac{16}{4 - \\\\frac{8}{4}} = 8$.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimum value of $\\\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$ is $8$. However, this is not a valid solution, because the AM-GM inequality gives us a lower bound for the function, but we need to find the minimum value.\\n\\nLet's try a different approach. Instead of minimizing the original expression, let's maximize the denominator $a - \\\\frac{8}{a}$. Taking the derivative of $a - \\\\frac{8}{a}$ with respect to $a$ and setting it equal to zero gives us $a = 2\\\\sqrt{2}$. Substituting $a = 2\\\\sqrt{2}$ into the expression gives us $2\\\\sqrt{2} - \\\\frac{8}{2\\\\sqrt{2}} = 4$.\\n\\nTherefore, the maximum value of $a - \\\\frac{8}{a}$ is $4$. Now, we can divide the numerator $a^2 + \\\\frac{64}{a^2}$ by this maximum value to find the minimum value of the original expression. This gives us $\\\\frac{a^2 + \\\\frac{64}{a^2}}{4} \\\\geq \\\\frac{64}{4} = 16$.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimum value of $\\\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a - b}$ is $16$.
